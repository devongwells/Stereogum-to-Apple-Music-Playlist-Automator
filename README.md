# Stereogum Script

This is a fresh repository for the “Stereogum Script” project.

Getting started
- Add your code in this folder. I can scaffold a preferred stack (Node, Python, etc.).
- To initialize dependencies or tooling, tell me what you’d like (e.g., npm, pip, playwright, eslint).

Next steps
- Want me to create a GitHub repo and push it (public or private)?
- Prefer a starter template? I can add one.
